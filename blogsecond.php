                        when I’m working with a full-time job. You will learn: <br>

                    To start your self-learning, you need to learn for free on the internet. Its recommendations are
                    based on a review of the existing academic literature which is complemented by the analysis of
                    numerous contributions by software developers, self-learners, and teachers of programming.
                    Additionally, it incorporates effective learning techniques derived from psychological research. Its
                    intended readers are primarily entrepreneurs and ‘startup people’ who are driven to build new
                    businesses with code, although the proposed approach is also transferable to other domains and
                    audiences. <br>

                    The single most important factor for succeeding in learning programming has been found to be of
                    human nature: learner motivation and persistence. While most beginners and the majority of academic
                    contributions focus mostly on technical aspects such as which language to learn first, or which
                    learning resources to use, this paper analyzes the learning process itself. Learning programming is
                    thus divided into three main steps: <br>
                    <span> First,</span> I highlight the importance of setting a strong learning goal for motivation,
                    and provide a
                    big-picture overview of what ‘learning programming’ encompasses to structure the approach. <br>
                    <span> Second,</span> I provide learners with recommendations as to which language to learn first -
                    there is no
                    one ‘best’ choice - as well as how and where to find effective learning resources. <br>
                    <span> Lastly,</span> the paper concludes with tips for optimizing the learning process by
                    introducing effective
                    learning techniques, highlighting the importance of programming practice, and collecting additional
                    advice from programmers and self-learners. <br>

                <p>
                    While it's nice to think you can hack your way to success, whenever you try to accomplish a huge
                    goal -- like starting and growing a business -- skills matter. Who you know is certainly important.
                    <br>
                    But what you know, and what you can do, matters a whole lot more. <br>
                    Which means the faster you learn, the more successful you can be. <br>

                    So let's jump right in.Here are five ways, backed by science, to speed up the learning process. <br>

                    <span> Take notes by hand, not on a computer</span>
                    Most of us can type faster than we can write. (And a lot more neatly.) <br>
                    But research shows handwriting your notes means you'll learn more. Oddly enough, taking notes by
                    hand enhances both comprehension and retention, possibly because instead of just serving as a
                    quasi-stenographer, you're forced to put things in your own words in order to keep up. <br>
                    Which means you'll remember what you heard a lot longer. <br>

                    <span> 2. Chunk your study sessions.</span> <br>
                    You're busy. So you wait until the last minute to learn what you need to know: A presentation, a
                    sales demo, an investor pitch... <br>
                    Bad idea. Research shows "distributed practice" is a much more effective way to learn. <br>
                    Imagine you want to nail your investor pitch. Once you've drafted your pitch, run through it once.
                    Then take a few minutes to make corrections and revisions. <br>

                    <span> 3. Test yourself. A lot.</span> <br>
                    A number of studies show that self-testing is an extremely effective way to speed up the learning
                    process. <br>
                    Partly that's due to the additional context created; if you test yourself and answer incorrectly,
                    not only are you more likely to remember the right answer after you look it up... you'll also
                    remember that you didn't remember. (Getting something wrong is a great way to remember it the next
                    time, especially if you tend to be hard on yourself.) <br>


                    <span> 4. Change the way you practice.</span> <br>
                    Repeating anything over and over again in the hopes you will master that task will not only keep you
                    from improving as quickly as you could, in some cases it may actually decrease your skill. <br>
                    According to recent research from Johns Hopkins, if you practice a slightly modified version of a
                    task you want to master, "you actually learn more and faster than if you just keep practicing the
                    exact same thing multiple times in a row." The most likely cause is reconsolidation, a process where
                    existing memories are recalled and modified with new knowledge. <br>

                    <span>5. Teach someone else.</span> <br>
                    It may be occasionally true that those who can't, teach... but research shows it's definitely true
                    that those who teach speed up their learning and retain more. <br>
                    Even just thinking that you'll need to teach someone can make you learn more effectively. According
                    to the researchers, "When teachers prepare to teach, they tend to seek out key points and organize
                    information into a coherent structure. Our results suggest that students also turn to these types of
                    effective learning strategies when they expect to teach." <br>
